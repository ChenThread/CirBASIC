CirBASIC Hello profile

Completely useless to actually code with, but it provides a nice early milestone for implementors to feel good about themselves and carry on to the next profile.

Command string comparisons are case insensitive.

Every line that isn't "RUN" is printed in the form "line %s\n".

Whitespace is 0x20 (space) and 0x09 (tab).

Syntax:

    line ::= digit WS+ stmt | WS* stmt
    stmt ::= "RUN" | ANY*
    digit ::= '0' - '9'

Limits:

* Command input buffer length: 255 bytes (excluding newline)
