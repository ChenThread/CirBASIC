The CirBASIC suite

This should eventually contain the following:

* The Hello, Tiny, and Usable profiles of CirBASIC
* Reference implementations of the CirBASIC profiles in C99/C11
* Assemblers written in the Usable profile of CirBASIC
* Per-CPU implementations of CirBASIC written in assembly using the syntax of the appropriate assembler written in CirBASIC

This approach actually does make sense.
